** Description:     The source code file for the BlueMen class defines
**                  the constructor for a BlueMen character, setting
**                  the character's armor, strength, and type, as well as 
**                  the functions for a Blue Men's particular attack roll, 
**                  defense roll, and calculating the damage from an attack.
