** Description:     The source code file for the HarryPotter class defines
**                  the constructor for a Harry Pottter character as well as 
**                  the functions for attack, taking damage, and defense.
**                  This file also includes getter and setter functions
**                  for the Harry Potter life counter, which tracks
**                  if HP is on his second life, using his Hogwarts
**                  special ability.
